# Use `fetch()`

## Learning Goals

- Explain how to fetch data with `fetch()`

- Identify examples of the AJAX technique on popular websites

## Introduction

When it comes to making engaging web sites, we often find ourselves needing to
send a lot of data (text, images, media, etc.) so that the page is exciting.

**But** browsers won't show anything until they've processed all the of that
data. As a result, they show nothing. The screen stays blank and users
experience "waiting."

Too much waiting means visitors will click away and never come back. Web users
expect sites to load quickly **and** to stay updated. Research shows that 40
percent of visitors to a website will leave if the site takes more than 3
seconds to load. Mobile users are even _less_ patient.

To solve this problem and help provide lots of other really great features, we
developed a technique called **_AJAX_**.

In AJAX we:

1. Deliver an initial, engaging page using HTML and CSS which browsers render
   _quickly_
2. _Then_ we use JavaScript to add more to the DOM, behind the scenes

AJAX relies on several technologies:

* Things called `Promise`s
* Things called `XMLHttpRequestObject`s
* A [serialization format][sf] called JSON for "JavaScript Object Notation"
* [asynchronous Input / Output][asyncIO]
* [the event loop][el]

Part of what makes AJAX complicated to learn is that to understand it
_thoroughly_, you need to understand _all_ these components. For the moment,
however, we're going to gloss over all these pieces in this lesson. It just so
happens that modern browsers have _abstracted_ all those components into a
single function called `fetch()`. While someone interviewing to be a front-end
developer will be expected to be able to explain all those components above
(which we _will_ cover later), while we're getting a hang of things, we're
going to simplify our task by using `fetch()`.

Let's learn to use `fetch()` to apply the AJAX technique: a way to load
additional data _after_ information is presented to the user.

## Explain How to Fetch Data with `fetch()`

The `fetch()` function retrieves data. It's a global _method_ on the `window`
object. That means you can simply use it with `fetch()` in DevTools.

Here's the skeleton for using it. We'll provide it again with lots of comments
so you can step through what's happening, but for a quick reference, here's
the skeleton:

```js
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function(json){
    // Use this data inside of `json` to do DOM manipulation
  })
```

Let's add some in-line JavaScript contents to help us track what's going on.
Since JavaScript doesn't care about comments or whitespace, we're going to add
multi-line (`/*...*/`) comments to help explain what's going on:

```js
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
  /*
    The function above returns an object that represents what the data source
    sent back. It does *not* return the actual content.

    We have to call the then() method on the object that comes back. then()
    takes as its argument a function that receives the response as its argument.
    Inside of the function, we do whatever processing we need, but at the end we
    *have to return* the content that we've gotten out of the response.

    The response has some basic functions on it for the most common data types.
    The most important ones are .json() and .text().

    This callback function is usually only one line: returning the content from
    the response. What we return from this function will be used in the _next_
    then() function.
  */

  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })

  /*
    The function above returns the content from the response.
    We can use that content inside of the callback function that's
    passed in to the then() function below.
  */

  .then(function(json){
    // Use this data inside of `json` to do DOM manipulation
  })
```

### Filling Out the Example

Let's fill out our base skeleton.

First, we'll provide a `String` argument to `fetch()`.  As it happens,
`http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json` will provide a list of the humans in
space. You can paste this URL into a browser tab and see that this URL returns
a JSON structure.

JSON is a way to send a collection of data across in the internet. It just so
happens that this `String` is written in a way that would be valid JavaScript
syntax for an `Object` instance. Thus the name "JavaScript Object" notation or,
JSON ("jay-sawn"). Programmers find it very easy to think about JavaScript
`Object`s, so they often send their "stringified" version as responses.

The `then()` takes a function. Here is where you tell JavaScript to ask the
network response to be turned into JSON.  When you first start using `fetch()`
most of your first `then()`s are going to look like this:

```js
function(response) {
  return response.json();
}
```

The final `then()` is when you actually get some JSON passed in. You can then
do something with the JSON. The easiest options are

* `alert()` the JSON
* `console.log()` the JSON
* hand the JSON off to another function.

We'll go for the `console.log()` approach:

```js
function(json) {
  console.log(json)
}
```

> **STRETCH:** But you _should_ be able to imagine that you could do some DOM
> manipulation instead.

Here's a completed example:

```js
fetch('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json')
.then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
    })
.then(function(json) {
    console.log(json)
    });

```

Let's perform a demonstration. Navigate to http://open-notify.org in an **incognito** tab. We are using
incognito browser to make sure that none of your browsing history intereferes with this experiment.

Open up DevTools and paste the following:

```js
fetch('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json')
.then(function(response) {
  return response.json();
}).then(function(json) {
  console.log(json);
  console.log(`Holy cow! There are ${json["number"]} humans in space.`);
});
```

You might notice that this chained method call returned a `Promise` in the
DevTools console. We'll cover that later.

## Working Around Backwards Compatibility Issues

As you can see, `fetch()` provides us with a short way to fetch and work with
resources. However, `fetch()` has only recently arrived in browsers. In older
code you might see `jquery.ajax` or `$.ajax` or an object called an
`XMLHttpRequestObject`. These are distractions at this point in your education.
After working with `fetch()` you'll be able to more easily integrate these
special topics.

## Identify Examples of the AJAX Technique on Popular Websites

The AJAX technique opens up a lot of uses!

* It allows us to pull in dynamic content. The same "framing" HTML page remains
  on screen for a cooking website. The recipe on display updates _without_ page
  load. This approach was pioneered by GMail whose nav area is swapped
  for mail content swiftly &mdash; thanks to AJAX.
* It allows us to get data from multiple sources. We could make a website that
  displays the current weather forecast and the current price of bitcoin side
  by side! This approach is used by most sites to render ads. Your content loads
  while JavaScript gets the ad to show and injects it into your page (sometimes
  AJAX can be used in a way that we don't _entirely_ like).

## Conclusion

Many pages use AJAX to provide users fast and engaging sites. It's certainly
not required in all sites. Using it for every site is a step backward when
simple HTML would suffice. However, as sites have more and more material, the
AJAX technique is a great tool to have.

Using `fetch()`, we can include requests for data wherever we need to in
our code. We can `fetch()` data on the click of a button or the expansion of an
accordion display. There are many older methods for fetching data, but
`fetch()` is the future.
