# JavaScript Objects and Fetch

## Introduction

In the past few lessons, when we used `fetch` to get data, we got data
formatted as 'JSON'. _JSON_ stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_, and 
it comes from a JavaScript language feature for creating `Object`s.

Over the next few lessons, we'll cover the basics of working with `Object`s in
JavaScript. In particular, the lessons will cover:

- Syntax for `Object` literals
- Accessing `Object` properties with dot notation and bracket notation
- Adding and removing properties from `Object`s
- Traversing Nested `Object`s

That way, when we get data back from the server, we'll be comfortable working
with that data to build interactive frontend applications.
